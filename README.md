## Overview
This project demonstrates the sorting process of different algorithms by animating the steps on an HTML5 canvas. The project currently supports bubble sort and insertion sort.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5 Canvas API

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sorting-visualization.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd sorting-visualization
    ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser:
    ```bash
    open index.html
    ```

## Usage
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click on the buttons to visualize different sorting algorithms.
    - "Play Bubble Sort" to visualize bubble sort.
    - "Play Insertion Sort" to visualize insertion sort.

## Features
- Visual representation of sorting algorithms.
- Dynamic animation using HTML5 canvas.
- Easy-to-use interface to select and play sorting algorithms.

## Algorithms Implemented
- **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Insertion Sort**: A comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly picking the next item and inserting it into its correct position.
